# Java Dynamic Sql [jadys-api] 
JaDyS is a library develop to make it possible to 'talk' to SQL within Java code. 
The need to start a such project was a logical result from being tired debugging sometimes unreadable custom Sql that the first goal was to customize the way data are retrieved from DB.

### Similar projects
You may find the sql statement pipping are similar to other available API such as Querydsl, jOOQ and even  Zend_Db_Select.
I could just use them also, but something was still missing. I hope this tool will help you all, and make you love SQL better than before.
